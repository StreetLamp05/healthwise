                <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed">
                    In a world where seasonal flu outbreaks can strain healthcare systems and disrupt daily life, staying one step ahead can make all the difference. HealthWise empowers communities by predicting future influenza-like illness (ILI) prevalence across the United States.
                </p>
                <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed mt-2">
                    By harnessing the power of machine learning and leveraging historical flu trends alongside socio-economic data, HealthWise forecasts ILI rates with remarkable accuracy. These insights are visualized through dynamic heat maps, helping users identify high-risk areas at a glance and take proactive measures to protect their health and well-being.
